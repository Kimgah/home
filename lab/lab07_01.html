<div id="aladin">Aladdin is a 1992 American animated musical
    fantasy comedy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and
    released by Walt Disney Pictures. The film was produced and directed
    by Ron Clements and John Musker, and is based on the Arabic folktale
    of the same name from the One Thousand and One Nights.
    The voice cast features Scott Weinger, Robin Williams,
    Linda Larkin, and Jonathan Freeman. The film follows the titular Aladdin,
    an Arabian street urchin, who finds a magic lamp containing a genie. With the genie's help,
    Aladdin disguises himself as a wealthy prince and tries to impress the Sultan in order to
    marry his free-spirited daughter, Princess Jasmine, while the Sultan's evil vizier Jafar
    plots to steal the magic lamp for his own uses.</div>
<div>Lyricist Howard Ashman first pitched the idea, and the screenplay went
    through three drafts before then-Disney Studios president Jeffrey Katzenberg
    agreed to its production. The animators based their designs on the work of caricaturist
    Al Hirschfeld, and computers were used for both finishing the artwork and creating
    some animated elements. The musical score was written by Alan Menken and features
    six songs with lyrics written by both Ashman and Sir Tim Rice, who took over after
    Ashman's death.</div>
